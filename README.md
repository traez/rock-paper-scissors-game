## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

1. I've long been able to think in JavaScript. But the biggest flex from recently completing multiple Next.js projects, is that I've also now learned to think in React. I'm no more lost. I'm now comfortable reasoning out solutions to problems using React logic.ðŸ˜Š   

### Continued development

More Next.js projects. GraphQL projects too in the longer term.
